# ARCHIVED


SLT Terminal Wi-fi Checker is now archived and will no longer be maintained.
Please see [SLT-Usage-Analyzer](https://github.com/gamithaKalharaW/SLT-Usage-Analyzer) for a more up to date, maintained solution.
SLT Terminal Wi-fi Checker was archived due to difficult maintainance and inability to easily extend its functionality.
Furthermore, reliance on a webdriver managed by the user was a major draw back.
[SLT-Usage-Analyzer](https://github.com/gamithaKalharaW/SLT-Usage-Analyzer) was created to address these issues as a complete replacement rather than a patch work of fixes.
